			<li>Statue of Liberty and Battery Park<br><img src="images/ul1.jpg"><br>The Statue of Liberty was France's gift to America. It was built in 1886 and remains a famous world symbol of freedom and one of the greatest American icons. It is the world's largest statue and stands just less than 152 feet tall from the base to the torch, and weighs approximately 450,000 pounds. The statue offers a fine view of the New York Harbor and lower Manhattan. </li>
			<li>Empire State Building<br><img src="images/ul2.jpg"><br>Along with the Statue of Liberty, The Empire State Building is New York's most famous landmark. The 381 m tall, 102-storey building was the tallest in the world until the 1 World Trade Center tower rose higher 41 years later. Topped with a mooring mast for airships, the Empire State Building immediately became a landmark and a symbol for NYC when it opened in 1931. There are actually two observatories atop the Empire State Building.</li>	
			<li>Central Park<br><img src="images/ul3.jpg"><br>Central Park is the playground of New Yorker's. This huge park in the city center is one of the things that makes New York such a beautiful city and not simply a concrete jungle. The park has many attractions within its borders and has been featured in countless TV shows and movies. Some of the places of note within this green space that visitors will probably be familiar with are Strawberry Fields.</li>

The bridge is an American landmark that has inspired generations of poets, songwriters and painters. Engineer John Roebling conceived of the bridge in 1855 and worked out every detail from its two granite towers to its four suspended steel cables.</li>
			<li>Times Square<br><img src="images/ul9.jpg"><br>Formerly Longacre Square, Times Square was named in 1904 after the New York Times tower. The newspaper first posted current headlines along its famous moving sign, the world's first, in 1928.
